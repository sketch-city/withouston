## Background  

Women In Tech: Houston is a connector and community builder for all women in tech in the Houston area. We foster supportive leadership, community, creative business disruption and economic development by and for women.

## How you can get involved 

1. Contribute to the website  
We own http://withouston.org/ and have put up a placeholder theme. This is a simple Wordpress site, the purpose of which is to provide information on local women in tech groups, upcoming events, and educational opportunities. You can help make it amazing by writing content, designing, and/or coding. 

2. Donate your space or other resources  
Do you own a coffee shop, bar, or other local business that could host ~50 women for networking events? Or a space that is or could easily be a classroom? Or a larger space for a hackathon? 

3. Spread the word  
Like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WITHoustonOrg/

4. Send us your ideas  
This is a community group, which means the community gets to define it together. If you have a great idea for group activities, community building exercises, classes, or something else entirely, let us know in the comments. Thanks!
