## Background  

Women In Tech: Houston is a connector and community builder for all women in the tech industry in the Houston area. We foster supportive leadership, community, creative business disruption and economic development by and for women.  

When women help each other, amazing things can happen. Mentorships are formed. Partnerships are forged. Professional careers leap forward. That’s what “Women In Technology: Houston” is all about: we are working to bring all women in technology — from astronauts to designers to biohackers to makers to everyone in between — together to share ideas, support each other and grow our community.  

## How you can get involved 

1. Contribute to the website  
We own http://withouston.org/ and have put up a placeholder theme. This is a simple Wordpress site, the purpose of which is to provide information on local women in tech groups, upcoming events, and educational opportunities. You can help make it amazing by writing content, designing, and/or coding. 

2. Donate your space or other resources  
Do you own a coffee shop, bar, or other local business that could host ~50 women for networking events? Or a space that is or could easily be a classroom? Or a larger space for a hackathon? 

3. Contribute to the directory 
We’re working on a directory and map of organizations, programs and resources that help advance women in technology, from the classroom to the boardroom. Know of something/someone we should include? Tell us in the Slack: https://withouston.slack.com/ 

4. Spread the word  
Like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/WITHoustonOrg/

5. Send us your ideas  
This is a community group, which means the community gets to define it together. If you have a great idea for group activities, community building exercises, classes, or something else entirely, let us know in the comments or join the Slack: https://withouston.slack.com/  

Thanks!
